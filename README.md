# Task 8 - VPN Privacy Protection Using Proton VPN

## 🛡 Objective
This task involved understanding how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) work to protect user privacy and secure internet communication. The goal was to gain hands-on experience by setting up and using a free VPN service.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Proton VPN (Free Tier)
- Web browser
- Website for IP check:(https://whatsmyip.com/)

## 📋 Steps Followed

1. *Downloaded Proton VPN* from the official website: [(https://protonvpn.com)]
2. *Created a free account* and verified the email address.
3. *Installed and launched the Proton VPN client* on my system.
4. *Logged into the Proton VPN app* using my credentials.
5. *Connected to a VPN server* (I selected the fastest available server in the nearby region).
6. *Verified my IP address* before and after connecting via (https://whatsmyip.com/) to confirm it had changed.
7. *Browsed multiple websites* to ensure encrypted traffic and accessibility worked fine.
8. *Disconnected the VPN* and tested normal speed and IP to observe the differences.

## 🧪 Observations

- *Before VPN*: IP location reflected my actual location.
- *After VPN*: IP location changed to the VPN server's location.
- *Encryption*: Internet traffic was encrypted during VPN usage.
- *Speed*: Browsing speed slightly reduced while connected to VPN, but acceptable.
- *Access*: Websites opened normally without errors.

## ✅ Benefits Experienced

- Protected my actual IP and location
- Secured traffic from ISP monitoring
- Helped bypass content restrictions for testing

## ⚠ Limitations Noted

- Free servers are limited and can be crowded
- Slight performance lag on some websites
- VPN does not guarantee full anonymity if logged into personal accounts

## 📷 Screenshots Included

- Screenshot of Proton VPN connected status
- IP address verification before and after VPN connection

## 🔐 Key Takeaways

- VPNs are effective tools for protecting online identity and traffic.
- They use encryption and tunneling protocols to secure data.
- While useful, VPNs have limitations and should be used with other privacy tools for full security.
